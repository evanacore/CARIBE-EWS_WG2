Repository for Caribe-EWS codes for detection time models of different seismic station geometries. 

Calculation script: DetectTime_Generic - python notebook to calculate detection time. Requires Obspy, Pandas, and Numpy
Example Plotting script: Plot_TTGeneric-  Script to plat results of DetectTime_Generic using PyGMT. 
Example Data: carib_stats.csv; A CSV file containing the station locations. 

To run the code: 
1. run DetectTime_Generic after changing parameters of choice in the notbok
2. run the plot script to produce the map
